 Contributing

When coding, please keep in mind the general idea of the formatting that has been used before you. For example, don't name something that was named "Module" a handler in your code. If you can, pelase attach JavaDocs to your classes and methods. It is also preffered that you include a copy of the MIT license in each file you commit, but we'll add that if nessesary.
