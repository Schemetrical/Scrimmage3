## Contributing

When coding, please keep in mind the general idea of the formatting that has been used before you. For example, don't name something that was named "Module" a handler in your code. If you can, pelase attach JavaDocs to your classes and methods. It is also preffered that you include a copy of the [MIT license](https://github.com/OCNScrim/Scrimmage3/blob/master/LICENSE) in each file you commit, but we'll add that if nessesary.

## Coding guidelines
- Use an IDE (ex. Eclipse, NetBeans)
- Check for null values, so there are no `NullPointerException`
- Use full variable names (ex. `Element childElement`, not `Element c`)
- Try not to use deprecated methods
- Use correct indentation
- Use your IDE's formatter
- Include JavaDocs in your classes
- Do not include unnecessary comments
- Check that a class/method you're including has not already been implemented
